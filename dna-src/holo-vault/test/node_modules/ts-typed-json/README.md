# Typed JSON

This library is a set of type definitions and utilities
for dealing with JSON data in a type-safe way with TypeScript.
The most important type definitions are `JsonValue`, `JsonObject`,
and `JsonArray`, which correspond respectively to JSON values,
objects, and arrays, as the names suggest.

The library also exports safely-typed versions of `JSON.parse()`
and `JSON.stringify()`.
