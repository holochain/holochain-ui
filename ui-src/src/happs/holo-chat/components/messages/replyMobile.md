# Reply to a message
You can reply to a message on mobile.
You can use any type of message as the reply.
  Example is we are having a chat, and I reply with an auto-filled IdeaCard.
In order to better keep context, we will have an intuitive way to reply rather than drop new messages all the time like a normal chat.

To keep that context, replies always have a subject.
