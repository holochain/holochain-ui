**First Time Use**
The first time you that would like access to your personal information there will be no personas in the *Holo Vault*. You can add a new Persona and add as many fields to it as you like. Most people will probably have a *Personal*, *Work* and a *Friends* persona. With Personas you can use different versions of your name, nick names, info such as your Driver License etc.

**Try it out**
To get to this form you clicked the **New Persona** button on the **Personas** screen. Now click the **Add Field** button and type in the name of the piece of info you are adding into the *Field Name* text box such as *firstName* and then type in your name into the *Field Value* text box.
Now click the **Create Persona** button and check out the *Action Logger* tab to see the object that will get transformed from the form values into a new *Person* object'

```
{
    "name": "Personal",
    "persona": [
        {"firstName": "Phil"},
        {"lastName": "Beadle"},
        {"address": "123 Holochain Road"},
        {"suburb": "Burwood"},
        {"city": "Melbourne"}
    ]
}
```
