** Not Mapped No Matching Defaults **

When a profile request loads it will try to find matching fields in any personas you have. In the case where the field cannot be found in any persona the value is left empty and the new information will be added to the Default persona with the profile field name.

Example: The profile is requesting your favourite Genre.
You can see there is a field called "Genre", and if you enter say "Techno" that field and info will be added to the Default persona with a new field "genre".

** Power User Tip **
Click the Persona icon to the right of the field and you can modify the Persona this field is added to including adding a new one and change the name of the field. The field name auto complete uses a standard set of field names so we can encourage interoperability of profile info across hApps.
